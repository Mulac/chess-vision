How do we label empty squares?
    we could do with a label class (tightly coupled with chess.Piece)
    Can we prove that it's much harder to detect empty squares?  paried t-tests?

Are we flipping the board correctly?

Idea: send a whole board image as well as a square to detect colour of that square.
    It may be hard to tell the colour of a piece without reference to other pieces and 
    squares on the board due to lighting differences.

TODO:
 - LR scheduling (cosine annealing)
 - Visualise CNN layers
 - Calculate top-n accuracy
 - Compare freezing layers in transfer learning
 - Try combining models
