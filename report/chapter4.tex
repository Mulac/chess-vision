\section{Ideas for future work}
Firstly it would be nice for more extreme camera angles to work just as reliably.  If assumptions about the environment are to be kept minimal
then localising pieces in 3 dimensional space should be a requirement for robotic manipulation to be possible.

It is the author's belief that "3d reconstruction" would kill two birds with one stone and the direction that future research should focus.

Explain.  Similar work in other areas.
