Chessboard state prediction is the task of generating a digital representation of a real chessboard from an image.
This report details the creation of such a system that outperforms the best openly available solutions.
A novel auto labelling pipeline is used to collect a large dataset with minimal effort.  Further to this an application 
is built that is able to successfully record chess games to PGN from a video stream.  
The proposed solution, auto labelling pipeline and PGN recording application have been made open source and is available for use at 
github.
