\section{Introduction}

Algorithms such as Deep Blue \cite{parikh1980adaptive}, AlphaZero \cite{} and more recently Player of Games\cite{}
have enabled computers to out smart the smartest humans at the game of Chess.
But all these algorithms are bound to the digital world, rendered useless when
competing against humans on a real board. This project aims to explore a major
component of this: vision.
We consider the vision problem for chess to be two-fold; what is the current board
state and where are all of the pieces?  With this information, in combination with the
previous algorithms, and a robot arm, the computer is no longer bound to the
digital world.

% Must provide evidence of a literature review. Use sections
% and subsections as they make sense for your project.
\section{Literature review}
When we ask ourselves: what is the hard part of Chess?  
One may think it's the strategy, another may say anticipating what the opposition
is going to do next and the more statistical among us may formulate it as choosing the most likely action for victory.  
It is highly unlikely, however, that one would say it is locating where the pieces are in 3D space.

For computers this is among the hardest of the challenges.  
Make reference to humans huge allocation of resources to vision. \cite{}
Why is it so hard for computers then? It's an inverse problem. 
Compare to solving the decision problem (minimax).  
The statistal calculation of whether to trade Queen's or block with a pawn has now become trival.  

\subsection{A Short History of Computer Vision}
\subsubsection{Classical Techniques}
How we can use classical techniques to understand images.  Neural networks have taken over almost all of the heavy lifting for high level inference.
Give an indication of time scale here.
\subsubsection{Image Recognition}
Le Ye Cunn's work with convolutions \cite{} and MNIST \cite{} and more recently ImageNet \cite{} having become incredibly well known.
New methods such as Transformers from the world have NLP have generalised the convolution operation have proved 
very successful and lots of work here has been applied to vision. \cite{} \cite{} \cite{} (Attention is all you need, ViT, generic model from deepmind)
\subsubsection{Object Detection}
But in most applications there will be many things we want to recognise in an image.  The RCNN \cite{} enters.  How Faster-RCNN improves on this \cite{}.
Why YOLO \cite{} has been so successful (realtime).  Transformers are applicable here too.
\subsubsection{Instance Segmentation}
Why bounding boxes are not enough.  What is segmentation? Why instance segmentation is what we actually want. \cite{}
\subsubsection{Adding More Dimensions}
The real world is not percepived in static 2d images.  How do we add an understanding of 3 dimensions and time in our computer vision models? \cite{}
Important for localisation in the real world.  Important for understanding things like object permenance.


\subsection{Computer Vision for Chess}
Finding the chess board is the first challenge, the most common solution as in \cite{} 
is to use the `findChessboard` function in openCV for camera calibration.  This **how does 
this work**.
