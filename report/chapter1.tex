\section{Introduction}

Algorithms such as Deep Blue \cite{parikh1980adaptive}, AlphaZero \cite{} and more recently Player of Games\cite{}
have enabled computers to out smart the smartest humans at the game of Chess.
But all these algorithms are bound to the digital world, rendered useless when
competing against humans on a real board. This project aims to explore a major
component of this: vision.
Consider the vision problem for chess to be two-fold: what is the current board
state and where are all of the pieces?  With this information, in combination with the
previous algorithms and a robot arm, the computer is no longer bound to the
digital world.
In particular this project's will focus on the former, that is, to produce and present a solution for determining the
state of a chess board from a video stream.  A solution reliable enough to live up to the likes of AlphaZero 
in a robotic solution.  There will be a focus on deep learning techniques, with
consideration for best practice in machine learning operations.  There is also the aim to share the 
tools to more easily manage and create new datasets in this area of chessboard state recognition.  Something 
called for by \cite{} as a serious challenge and priority for future research.

% Must provide evidence of a literature review. Use sections
% and subsections as they make sense for your project.
\section{Literature review}
\label{research}
For humans the hard part of chess is planning, this is not the case for computers, instead 
recognition and localisation of objects in 3D space, along with manipulation, present much greater
challenges. \cite{}

Make reference to humans huge allocation of resources to vision. \cite{}
Why is it so hard for computers then? It's an inverse problem. 
Compare to solving the decision problem (minimax).  
The statistal calculation of whether to trade Queen's or block with a pawn has now become trival.  

\subsection{A Short History of Computer Vision}
\subsubsection{Classical Techniques}
How we can use classical techniques to understand images.  Neural networks have taken over almost all of the heavy lifting for high level inference.
Give an indication of time scale here.
\subsubsection{Image Recognition}
the way back in 1980 \cite{} convolutions showed promise in simple computer vision tasks, 
convolutions since have showed extreme promise \cite{}
Le Ye Cunn's work with convolutions \cite{} and MNIST \cite{} and more recently ImageNet \cite{} having become incredibly well known.
New methods such as Transformers from the world have NLP have generalised the convolution operation have proved 
very successful and lots of work here has been applied to vision. \cite{} \cite{} \cite{} (Attention is all you need, ViT, generic model from deepmind)
\subsubsection{Object Detection}
But in most applications there will be many things we want to recognise in an image.  The RCNN \cite{} enters.  How Faster-RCNN improves on this \cite{}.
Why YOLO \cite{} has been so successful (realtime).  Transformers are applicable here too.
\subsubsection{Instance Segmentation}
Why bounding boxes are not enough.  What is segmentation? Why instance segmentation is what we actually want. \cite{}
\subsubsection{Adding More Dimensions}
The real world is not percepived in static 2d images.  How do we add an understanding of 3 dimensions and time in our computer vision models? \cite{}
Important for localisation in the real world.  Important for understanding things like object permenance.

\subsection{Computer Vision for Chess}
Despite chess being a very narrow application of computer vision, the amount of research effort gone into the problem is not insignificant, 
in contrary to some papers claims \cite{}.  A variety of approaches have been tested and explored for which the following section will attempt to fairly summarise.
Finding the chess board is the first challenge, the most common solution as in \cite{} 
is to use the `findChessboard` function in openCV for camera calibration.  This **how does 
this work**.  

\subsection{Prior Work From the Author}
Mention robotic arm for two counter board games and automatic differentiation library.
